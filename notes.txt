UseState:

1. The UseState hook lets you add state to functional components
2. In classes, state is always an object, with hooks, state doesnt need to be an object
3. The UseState hook returns an array with two elements: the current value of the state, and the setter method
4. If state value depends on previous value, pass a lambda to the state's setter method
5. When deaing with object or array, always spread it in the setter before using it
